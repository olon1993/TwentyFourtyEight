# TwentyFourtyEight
General Description:
This project is a simple implementation of the popular 2048 game. 
Because I enjoy the game so much I wanted to create my own version.

Known Issues:
1) The game allows players to make moves that do not change the board and counts them as legal
2) The game detects a gameover one turn late

Version History:
A) V0.3
The game now responds to the directional buttons being pressed.

B) V0.2
The game is still mostly text based, however a JavaFX GUI has been added which includes buttons for each move (instead of text input, as it was prior to the GUI being added).

C) V0.1
Currently the game runs in the console and is entirely text based.
